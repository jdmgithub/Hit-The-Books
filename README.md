Hit-The-Books
=============
Version 1.0.0

This App was created as an educational tool to help students learn vocabulary words. There are 749 hidden words that come from Dr. Fryâ€™s list of High Frequency Words.

This App is my final project for the Atlanta Spring 2014 Iron Yard Mobile Engineering Course.  A special thanks goes out to Jo Albright, the IOS instructor, and my fellow students in the class.  Their support and encouragement helped more than they know.

Game-Based Learning

Digital games significantly enhances  student learning.  An analysis of fifty-seven studies comparing digital game vs. non-game instruction showed that game instruction was more effective than non-game instruction.
